# Flash Chat Web App

This is a web app that allows users to type into the chat page. Different users get different colors for their messages. Messages appear in a random location on the canvas. Each message also disappears after 5 second.

`firebase-init.js` contains the integration information for firebase firestore that includes a collection named "texts".
